#### Successes
Honestly, my successes were mostly just being able to work through (not all but) a lot of my issues so please read that part instead.
 - Being able to run on android platform (see issue #1)
 - Being able to generate services and pages and navigate.
 - Being able to pull some data from an API
 - Being able to work through this calmly without pulling all my hair out
 - Getting more famililarity with working in the CLI for FE (I just switched from a Mac to a Windows so I had to get accustomed to all the different commands I was unfamiliar with e.g. clear vs cls, rm vs del)

#### Issues
 - My biggest problem was the gradle! I spent hours and hours trying to figure out how to run even just the "Hello World" app on an android emulator on my laptop. I didn't understand because it told me to install Android Studio but it was already installed and updated to the latest version. I had to read a lot about system environment variables and paths to finally figure it out.
 - Had a lot of problems with APIs. Some were just not working, some were limited in functionality (on a free plan), and some had problems with the access key. 
 - I had some problems trying to figure out how to integrate both cordova and ionic. I had to restart the project a few times because I kept thinking the reason things weren't working (including the gradle) was because I set up my project wrong. Wasn't sure if I was suposed to create the Ionic or the cordova first.
 - Had some other issues Navigation and displaying API data.
 - For some reason a part of my css for android was not working.
 - cordova plugin works but I can't figure out how to delete sesison storage even when I deleted or cleared it in Inspect Element.

#### Future Development
I already Submitted my project but I am still continuing to implement and work on this project because I feel like I just need more time to figure out how to work through some of the issues I'm having. I want to finish implementing my News Page because that page was having some navigation problems which was making my entire app not work, so I deleted it for my submission. but I'd still like to see it.
